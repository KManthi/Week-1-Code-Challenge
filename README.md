# PHASE-1-WEEK-1-CODE-CHALLENGE

# Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

The first challenge(found in 'grade.js'), is a program that prompts a user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Depending on the input, the following grade output is given:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40.

# Challenge 2: Speed Detector

This is a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function  prints: “License suspended”.
