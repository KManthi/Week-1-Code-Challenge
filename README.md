<!-- # PHASE-1-WEEK-1-CODE-CHALLENGE

# Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

The first challenge(found in 'grade.js'), is a program that prompts a user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Depending on the input, the following grade output is given:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40.

# Challenge 2: Speed Detector

This is a program(found in 'speed.js') that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints: “License suspended”.

# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

This is a program(found in 'salary.js') whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.It calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. It also accounts for Housing Levy deductions.
